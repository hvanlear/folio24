        Our team faced the daunting task of overhauling our web-based BPMN
        modeling canvas tool. Users struggled with a cumbersome interface,
        limited maneuverability, and poor screen utilization. The inflexible
        menu structure hindered feature integration and scalability. Compounding
        these issues were a tight development timeline and a complex codebase
        with potential performance pitfalls. Our challenge was to transform
        these usability hurdles into a seamless, efficient user experience while
        navigating technical constraints and time pressures
